Name: Title, dtype: object","237169    Our client are an innovative technology based company. Formed around a decade ago in Ireland they utilise advanced technology to provide a unique remote visual surveillance solution. The service is sold to clients in Ireland, the UK, Africa, the Middle East and the United States. The technology lends itself well to a range of applications from high worth individuals residences through to commercial applications such as construction sites and wind farms, meaning there is a large potential client base. The company's service differs to conventional CCTV monitoring services in that the service is provided on a completely managed basis inhouse. The company installs the kit, monitors it, services it and updates it when required. The system is monitored from a purpose built communications hub by a team of well trained (and well paid) personnel, they will provide a tailored response agreed with the client should an intruder be detected (their technology means that this happens long before a conventional PIR system would), this could include a audible warning in real time by the operative identifying the intruder as if on site and contact with the police. Also unlike a conventional security system there are no upfront costs to the client. The service is paid for on a fixed fee daily basis with no other added costs and offers attractive financial and operational benefits over a conventional manned or CCTV monitored site. Please contact me for further details. Although the client has a strong established base in Ireland, the UK arm of the company is effectively a new technology start up, where creativity and entrepreneurial talents are valued, and with no boundaries the culture suit candidates who work best outside a defined framework and hierarchy.
